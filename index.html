  Because browsers are usually required to support all existing content on the 
  Web, there’s no reliance on the doctype to tell them which features should be supported in a given document. 
  In other words, the doctype alone is not going to make your pages HTML5-compliant. 
  It’s really up to the browser to do this. In fact, you can use one of those two older doctypes with new 
  HTML5 elements on the page and the page will render the same as it would if you used the new doctype.
